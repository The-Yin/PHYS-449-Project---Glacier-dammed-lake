# PHYS-449-Project---Glacier-dammed-lake
These codes aim to solve a practice problem by using shooting method and arc length continuation method.

The procedure is on script.mlx.

First, use @argument_generator to generator argument and use @arclength_continuation_method to get a structure fout that everything is inside it

Then, use @plot_find_extremum to find the maximum and minmum of x_i in every closed orbit for each parameter value

Then, we can start plot.

If we want to modify something even the whole system, only need to change of @argument_generator.
